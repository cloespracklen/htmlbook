  <h1>My sister got her finger bitten by a penguin! </h1>
  <h3> Here is how: </h3>
  <ol>
    <li> We went to the St.Louis Zoo one day. </li>
    <li> She stuck her hnad out to pet a penguin. </li>
    <li> A penguin snacked on her finger. </li>
    <li> She cried :( </li>
  </ol>
  <p> I am just trying to figure out how to make words <b> bold </b> and <i> italic </i>. </p>
